# Ansible Configuration Management - Automate Project 7 to 10

In Projects 7 to 10 we had to perform a lot of manual operations to set up virtual servers, install and configure the required software, and also deploy our web application.

This Project will make us appreciate DevOps tools even more by automating most of the routine tasks with Ansible Configuration Management, at the same time you will become confident at writing code using declarative language such as YAML.
