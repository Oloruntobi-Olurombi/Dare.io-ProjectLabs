# Understanding Client-Server Architecture
- Client-Server refers to an architecture in which two or more computers are connected together over a network to send and receive requests between one another.

- In their communication, each machine has its own role: the machine sending requests is usually referred as "Client" and the machine responding (serving) is called "Server".
