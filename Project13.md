# Ansible Dynamic Assignments (Include) and Community Roles

### Please note that this is a continuation of project 12.

In our https://github.com/<your-name>/ansible-config-mgt GitHub repository start a new branch and call it dynamic-assignments.
- git checkout -b dynamic-assignments
  
Create a new folder, name it dynamic-assignments. Then inside this folder, create a new file and name it env-vars.yml.

We will instruct site.yml to include this playbook later. For now, we would keep building up the structure.
